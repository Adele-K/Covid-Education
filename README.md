# Covid-Education
We will be exploring the affects Covid-19 has had on students; their education and their mental health.
I have included a data analysis using Excel and SQL, where I delve into the responses of a group of students and understand the how they was feeling. 
We also have avariety of data visualisations to help us get to grips with all the information we will be exploring.

My Objective within this project is to investigate what correlation we see with the changes in delivered education and the behavior of students. I also want to explore how students react to education without a social environment.
