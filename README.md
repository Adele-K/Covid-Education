# Covid-Education
We will be exploring the affects Covid-19 has had on students; their education and their mental health.
I have included a data analysis using Excel and SQL, where I delve into the responses of a group of students and understand the how they was feeling. 
We also have avariety of data visualisations to help us get to grips with all the information we will be exploring.
